# 🐍 Python Comprehensions & Map Function – Employee List Exercise

## 📌 Project Overview
This exercise demonstrates how to **transform and manipulate lists of dictionaries in Python** using the `map()` function and comprehensions. The dataset consists of employee records, where each dictionary contains an `id`, `name`, and `department`.  

The task was to create functions that:
- Combine employee `name` and `department` into a single string.
- Apply transformations across the entire list using `map()`.
- Practice Pythonic approaches to **iteration, mapping, and list comprehensions**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Core Concepts:**  
  - Higher-order functions (`map()`)  
  - List comprehensions  
  - Dictionary manipulation  
  - Function definitions  

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how `map()` works with custom functions.  
- Writing **clean, Pythonic code** to transform structured data.  
- Using list comprehensions as a **concise alternative** to loops and `map()`.  
- Handling employee records in a structured way that mirrors **real-world data processing** tasks.  

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters
These skills are fundamental in **data analysis and ETL pipelines**:
- Converting raw data into usable formats.  
- Writing concise, maintainable code that scales.  
- Building a strong foundation for **more advanced transformations in Pandas and SQL**.  

---

## 🌱 Stretch Ideas
- Extend the exercise to filter employees by department.  
- Export the processed list to a **CSV/JSON file**.  
- Use `pandas` DataFrame for more advanced analysis.  
- Add error handling for missing fields in the employee dictionaries.
